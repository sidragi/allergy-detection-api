# Allergy Detection API

An AI-powered Allergy Detection API built with **FastAPI** that analyzes images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained with **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model determines whether an uploaded image shows signs of an allergy or not. Deployed on **Endeavor WH**, this project also includes a frontend interface for easier interaction.
